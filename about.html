        <div class="about">
            <p>I always thought that my dream job was to be a science teacher, but after several years I realized that
                something was missing from my professional life.
                <br>
                <br>
                Don’t get me wrong, I love the “ah-ha” moments of students learning something new and developing
                relationships with them, but I yearned to do more.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I discovered coding things clicked for me. The creativeness that I was missing in teaching was
                everywhere in coding.
                I love being able to create something new while simultaneously using problem solving skills. Breaking
                and
                tweaking code in order to improve it is so much fun!
                <br>
                <br>
                Technology has always been a forefront in my educational career and many times I’ve longed for an
                application or program to do something it wasn’t capable of. This set me on a path to learn to code.
                <br>
                <br>
                My specialties include being a lifelong learner, constantly improving my skills, responsive design,
                HTML,
                CSS, working well with others, being flexible
                and adaptive (you have to be to in order to survive as a teacher), creative problem solving skills, and
                multitasking.
